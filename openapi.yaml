        Submits a content generation request. The request is queued for 
        asynchronous processing. The process includes:
        
        1. Generation: Generates content based on request payload
        4. Synthesis: Synthesizes content into a structured document
        5. Publishing: Posts the document to Telegraph
        6. Notification: Sends an email with the document URL
        
        The API returns immediately with a request ID. The actual generation is performed 
        asynchronously by a backend worker.
